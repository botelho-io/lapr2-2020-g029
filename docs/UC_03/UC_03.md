|:--------------                                                                                |:----------------------                                         |:----------      |:----------------------------|
|1. Time starts the process of making payments on unpaid transactions of a certain organization.| … knows the transactions that need to be payed?                | Transaction     | Information expert (IE), Transaction is logically connected with PaymentDetails.|
|                                                                                               | … knows the freelancer to make the payment to?                 | Transaction     | IE: Transaction is connected to Freelancer in the MD. |
|                                                                                               | … is responsible for making payment transactions to the bank?  | Transaction     | IE: Transaction has all the necessary data to process the transaction to the bank. |
|                                                                                               | … stores the information that the transaction has been payed?  | PaymentDetail   | IE: in the MD PaymentDetail contains that information. |

### Systematization

It follows from the rational that the conceptual classes promoted to software classes are:

 * Transaction
 * Payment


Other software classes (i.e. Pure Fabrication) identified:

 * RegistPayment
 * ListTransaction
