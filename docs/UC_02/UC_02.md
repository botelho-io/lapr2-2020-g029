# UC02 - Create a Task

## 1. Requirements Engineering

### Brief Format

The collaborator stars the creating of a new task. The sistem request the task data (i.e. id, description, durationInHours, costPerHourOfJuniorEur, category). The collaborator enter the requested data. The sistem validates and presents the data, asking to comfirm. The collaborator confirms. The sistem **adds the new task information**  and informs the collaborator of the success of the operation.

### Complete format

#### Main actor

Collaborator

#### Partes interessadas e seus interesses
* **Collaborator:** pretends to add new tasks so that it can take advantage of the functionality provided by the app.
* **T4J:** pretends that new tasks can be added in order to use the app.


#### Preconditions
n/h

#### Postconditions
The registration information is saved in the system.

#### Main success scenario (or basic flow)

1. The collaborator stars the crating of a new task.
2. The sistem request the task data (i.e. id, description, durationInHours, costPerHourOfJuniorEur, category).
3. The collaborator enter the requested data.
4. The sistem validates and presents the data, asking to comfirm.
5. The collaborator confirms.
6. The sistem **adds the new task information**  and informs the collaborator of the success of the operation.

#### Extensions (or alternative flows)

*a. the collaborator requests to cancel the registration.

> Use case ends.

4a. Missing minimum required data.
>	1. The system informs you which data is missing.
>	2. The system allows you to enter the missing data (step 3)
>
	>	2a. the collaborator does not change the data. The use case ends.

4b. The system detects that the data (or some subset of the data) entered must be unique and that it already exists in the system.
>	1. The system alerts the collaborator to the fact.
>	2. The system allows you to change it (step 3)
>
	>	2a. the collaborator does not change the data. The use case ends.

#### List of Technologies and Data Variations

#### Frequency of Occurrence

#### Open questions

* Are there any other mandatory data in addition to those already known?
* Is there an additional security mechanism necessary to confirm that the task exists.
* What are the security rules applicable to the password?
* How often does this use case occur?

| Main Flow | Question: What Class... | Answer  | Justification  |
|:--------------  |:---------------------- |:----------|:---------------------------- |
|1. the administrator stars the adding of a new organiztion.|... interact with the user?| AddingOrganizacaoUI |Pure Fabrication|
| |... coordinate the UC?| AddingOrganizacaoController |Controller|
| |... creates instances of Organization?| App |Creator(regra1)|
|2. the sistem request the organization data (i.e. name) ,one manager of that organization (i.e. name, email and password) and one colaborator of the same organization  (i.e. name, email and password).||||
|3. the administrator enter the requested data. |... save the data entered?|Organization, Manager, Colaborator|IE: instance created in step 1|
| |... create instances of Manager?|Organization|creator(regra1)|
| |... create instances of Colaborator?|Organization|creator(regra1)|
|4. the sistem validates and presents the data, asking to comfirm. |... validates the Organization's data (local validation) |Organization |IE: has its own data|
| |... validates the Organization's data (local validation)| Manager |IE: has its own data|
| |... validates the Organization's data (local validation)| Colaborator | IE: has its own data|
| |... validates the Organization's data (local validation)| App | IE: The App has Organizations added|
|5. The Administrator confirms. ||||
|6. The sistem **adds the new organization information and the information about one manager and colaborator** and informs the admintrator of the success of the operation.|... saves the added Organization?| App |IE: In MD the App has Organization|
| |... register / keep the User's regarding the Organization's colaborator and manager?|AutorizationFacade|IE. User management is the responsibility of the respective external component whose point of interaction is through the class "AutorizationFacade"|



### Systematization ##

 It follows from the rational that the conceptual classes promoted to software classes are:

 * App
 * Administrator
 * Organization
 * Colaborator
 * Manager


Other software classes (i.e. Pure Fabrication) identified:  

 * AddingOrganizationUI  
 * AddingOrganizationController
