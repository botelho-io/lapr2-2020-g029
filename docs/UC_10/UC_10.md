## 3. Design - Use Case Realization

### Rational

| Main Flow | Question: What Class... | Answer  | Justification  |
|:--------------  |:---------------------- |:----------|:---------------------------- |
|1. Time starts the process of sending email´s to all freelancers.| … coordinates the UC?       | Delaycontroller | Controller. |
|                                                                                               | … knows the task is delayed?                | TaskExecutionDetails     | Information expert (IE), TaskExecutionDetails is logically connected with Task. |
|                                                                                               | … knows the freelancer to email to?        | TaskExecutionDetails     | IE: TaskExecutionDetails is connected to Freelancer in the MD. |
|                                                                                               | … is responsible to email?  | EmailAPI     | IE: EmailAPI has all the necessary data to process the email freelancer. |
|                                                                                               | … stores the information that the email has been send ?  | EmailScheduler   | IE: in the MD EmailScheduler contains all email sending information. |



### Systematization ##

 It follows from the rational that the conceptual classes promoted to software classes are:

 * App
 * Organization
 * EmailScheduler
 * Task
 * TaskExecutionDetails
 * Freelancer


Other software classes (i.e. Pure Fabrication) identified:

 * DelayController
 * TaskList
