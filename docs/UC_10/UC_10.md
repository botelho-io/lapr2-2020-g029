### Rational

| Main Flow | Question: What Class... | Answer  | Justification  |
|:--------------  |:---------------------- |:----------|:---------------------------- |
|1. Time starts the process of sending email´s to all freelancers.| … coordinates the UC?       | SendEmailTask | Controller. |
|                                                                                               | … knows the data about delay? |Transaction  |In the MD transaction contains TaskExecutionDetails.|
|                                                                                               | … knows the freelancer to email to?       |Transaction     | IE: Transaction is connected to Freelancer in the MD. |

|                                                                                               | … stores the information that the email has been send ?  | EmailScheduler   | IE: in the MD EmailScheduler contains all email sending information. |



### Systematization ##

 It follows from the rational that the conceptual classes promoted to software classes are:

 * App
 * Organization
 * EmailScheduler
 * TaskExecutionDetails
 * Freelancer
 * Transaction


Other software classes (i.e. Pure Fabrication) identified:

 * ListTransaction
 * SendEmailTask
