# UC07 - Visualize Overall Statistics About Task Execution Times

## 1. Requirements Engineering

### Brief Format

The collaborator or the manager stars the visualize of overall statistics about task execution times. The system request sorting of the data (i.e.name or payment value). The collaborator or the manager enter the requested data. The system presents the information ( mean and the standard deviation of the delays, of each one and of all freelancers; histogram to analyze the delays of each one and all the freelancers working to the organization; mean and the standard deviation of the payments made to each one of the freelancers).

### Complete format

#### Main actor

Collaborator
Manager

#### Interested Parties and Their Interests
* **Collaborator:** pretends to see and analyse information about the freelancer's task execution times.
* **Manager:** pretends to see and analyse information about the freelancer's task execution times.
* **Organization** pretends that information about task execution times can be visualize.

#### Pre-Conditions
The information of the task execution times is already saved in the system.

#### Pos-Conditions
\-

#### Main success scenario (or basic flow)

1. The collaborator or the manager stars the visualize of overall statistics about task execution times.
2. The system request sorting of the data (i.e.name or payment value).
3. The collaborator or the manager enter the requested data.
4. The system presents the information ( mean and the standard deviation of the delays, of each one and of all freelancers; histogram to analyze the delays of each one and all the freelancers working to the organization; mean and the standard deviation of the payments made to each one of the freelancers).

#### Extensions (or alternative flows)

*a. the collaborator or the manager requests to cancel the visualization.

> Use case ends.

4a. Missing minimum required data.
>	1. The system informs you which data is missing.
> Use case ends.


#### Special requirements
\-

#### List of Technologies and Data Variations
\-

#### Frequency of Occurrence
\-

#### Open questions

* How often does this use case occur?

### Rational

|Main Flow  |Question: What Class ... |Answer|Justification|
|:---------|:---------|:---------|:---------|
|1.  The collaborator or the manager start the visualize of overall statistics about task execution times.|… interacts with the user?|ManagerCollaboratorStatisticsUI|Pure Fabrication.|
||… coordinates the UC?|ManagerCollaboratorStatisticsController|Controller.|
|2. The system request sorting of the data (i.e.name or payment value).|… knows the sorting method?|ManagerCollaboratorStatisticsController| The ManagerCollaboratorStatisticsController has sorting methods|
|3.  The collaborator or the manager selects the method.||||
|4. The system presents the information ( mean and the standard deviation of the delays, of each one and of all freelancers; histogram to analyze the delays of each one and all the freelancers working to the organization; mean and the standard deviation of the payments made to each one of the freelancers).|… knows the data about the payment and delay?|Transaction|In the MD transaction contains TaskExecutionDetails.|
||… knows all the transactions made to the freelancers by a certain organization?|ListTransaction|By the IE principle Organization contains Transaction, however by the HC+LC principle, that responsibility has been assigned to ListTransaction.|
||… knows all the transactions made to the freelancers?|RegistOrganization|By the IE principle App contains Organization, however by the HC+LC principle, that responsibility has been assigned to RegistOrganization.|



### Systematization ##

 It follows from the rational that the conceptual classes promoted to software classes are:

 * App
 * Manager
 * Collaborator
 * Organization
 * Transaction
 * Freelancer
 * TaskExecutionDetails
 * Task


Other software classes (i.e. Pure Fabrication) identified:

 * ManagerCollaboratorStatisticsUI
 * ManagerCollaboratorStatisticsController
 * RegistOrganization
 * ListTransaction
